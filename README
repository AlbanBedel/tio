=== Go TTY - The Really Simple TTY Terminal Application ===


1. Introduction

    Go TTY or "gotty" is a really simple TTY terminal application which
    features a very simple commandline interface to easily connect to TTY
    devices for basic input/output.

    Go TTY was created by the author because he needed a no-nonsense simple TTY
    terminal application to go do quick debugging.

    Let's Go TTY!


2. Interface

    The commandline interface is really simple and pretty much self explanatory
    (output from 'gotty --help'):


        Usage: gotty [<options>] <device>

        Options:
          -b, --baudrate <baudrate>   Baud rate (default: 115200)
          -d, --databits 5|6|7|8      Data bits (default: 8)
          -f, --flow hard|soft|none   Flow control (default: none)
          -s, --stopbits 1|2          Stop bits (default: 1)
          -p, --parity even|odd|none  Parity (default: none)
          -n, --no-autoconnect        Disable automatic connect
          -v, --version               Display version
          -h, --help                  Display help

        In session, press ctrl-g + ctrl-q to quit.


    The only option which requires a bit of elaboration is the --no-autoconnect
    option.

    By default the gotty application automatically connects to the provided
    device if present. If the device is not present it will simply wait for it
    to appear and then connect. If the connection is lost (eg.  device
    disconnects) it will simply wait for the device to reappear and then
    reconnect.

    However, if the --no-autoconnect option is provided the gotty application
    will simply exit if the device is not present and it will also exit if an
    an established connection is lost (ie. no reconnect).
