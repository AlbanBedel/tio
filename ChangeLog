=== Go TTY v0.4 ===

Changes since Go TTY v0.3:

 * Fixed disconnect output

   In certain cases the disconnect message would eat a line of output from 
   the tty device (if any). This is now fixed.                             

 * Renamed stdio to new_stdout

   Since it is actually only stdout we configure.
